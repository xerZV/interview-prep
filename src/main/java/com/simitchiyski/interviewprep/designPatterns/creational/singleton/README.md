### Singleton Pattern

Singleton Pattern says that just "define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".

In other words, a class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.

##### Benefits:

 - Saves memory because object is not created at each request. Only single instance is reused again and again.
 
##### Usage:
 - Singleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications. It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.
