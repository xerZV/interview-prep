### Composite Pattern

A Composite Pattern says that just "allow clients to operate in generic manner on objects that may or may not represent a hierarchy of objects".

##### Benefits:

 - It defines class hierarchies that contain primitive and complex objects.
 - It makes easier to you to add new kinds of components.
 - It provides flexibility of structure with manageable class or interface.
 
##### Usage:
 - When you want to represent a full or partial hierarchy of objects.
 - When the responsibilities are needed to be added dynamically to the individual objects without affecting other objects. Where the responsibility of object may vary from time to time.
