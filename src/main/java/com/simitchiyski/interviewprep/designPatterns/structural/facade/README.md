### Facade Pattern

A Facade Pattern says that just "just provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client".

In other words, Facade Pattern describes a higher-level interface that makes the sub-system easier to use.

Practically, every Abstract Factory is a type of Facade.

##### Benefits:

 - It shields the clients from the complexities of the sub-system components.
 - It promotes loose coupling between subsystems and its clients.
 
##### Usage:
 - When you want to provide simple interface to a complex sub-system.
 - When several dependencies exist between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
