### Flyweight Pattern

A Flyweight Pattern says that just "to reuse already existing similar kind of objects by storing them and create new object when no matching object is found".

##### Benefits:

 - It reduces the number of objects.
 - It reduces the amount of memory and storage devices required if the objects are persisted
 
##### Usage:
 - When an application uses number of objects
 - When the storage cost is high because of the quantity of objects.
 - When the application does not depend on object identity.
